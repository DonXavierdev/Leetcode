'''
Given a string s, find any 
substring
 of length 2 which is also present in the reverse of s.

Return true if such a substring exists, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode"

Output: true

Explanation: Substring "ee" is of length 2 which is also present in reverse(s) == "edocteel".

Example 2:

Input: s = "abcba"

Output: true

Explanation: All of the substrings of length 2 "ab", "bc", "cb", "ba" are also present in reverse(s) == "abcba".

Example 3:

Input: s = "abcd"

Output: false

Explanation: There is no substring of length 2 in s, which is also present in the reverse of s.
